#### Notes:

Media library features (image save) require a physical device or properly configured emulator with permissions.

PDFs saved to app storage can be opened via native file apps.

## File Handling

Images: saved directly to device gallery using expo-media-library.

PDFs: saved to app storage with option to share or open in native apps.

Handles errors gracefully with alerts.

## Theming & Styling

All screens use a centralized theme in theme.ts.

Colors, spacing, and typography are extracted for consistency.

Each screen folder contains its own style file.

Shared components also have extracted styles.
